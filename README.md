# Laboratory-Management-System

To handle laboratory data effectively and efficiently, this project intends to create a laboratory
management system. The system is developed to handle the administration of laboratory data, including
test results, patient data, laboratorian data, and history. The system has function for data entry, data
retrieval, and data analysis and will be developed with a database management system. By minimising
the time and effort needed for data entry, retrieval, and analysis as well as by offering a centralised
platform for managing laboratory data, the laboratory management system will enhance laboratory
operations.
